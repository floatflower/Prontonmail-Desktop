ProtonMail Desktop
===

Developer: FloatFlower.Huang <floatflower@protonmail.com>

### What is this?

This is a desktop version of ProtonMail application, but actually the only thing I did was wrapping the web application by Electron.js
and add some desktop application features, like `minimize application to tray` and `only always-singleton window`.

I never collect personal data or anything else, and I am one of ProtonMail users, 
the purpose that I made this application is because I like desktop application more than web application, 
so just feel free and use it:)

### Download
